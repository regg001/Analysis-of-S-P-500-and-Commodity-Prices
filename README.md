# Analysis-of-S-P-500-and-Commodity-Prices
Data Science Project analyzing the trends between the S&amp;P 500 and commodities 

This project explores the relationship between the S&P 500 index and key commodity prices over time using R. It focuses on identifying correlations and patterns that could provide insights into market behavior.

# Objective:

To analyze historical trends between major U.S. market indices and commodities like oil, gold, and silver. The goal is to better understand how fluctuations in commodity prices relate to the performance of the S&P 500.
